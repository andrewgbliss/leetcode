# Math

Complementary number - The number derived by subtracting a number from a base number. For example, the tens complement of 8 is 2

# Modulus

x % 10 - This will give the right most digit

# Division

Math.floor(x / 10) - This will pull the most right digit off

# Finding the Middle

let middle = left + Math.floor((right - left) / 2);

# Hashmap

Can cache results of an algorithm for later use. So it doesn't have to recalculate the result.

# Divide and conquer

This technique can be divided into the following three parts:

Divide: This involves dividing the problem into smaller sub-problems.
Conquer: Solve sub-problems by calling recursively until solved.
Combine: Combine the sub-problems to get the final solution of the whole problem.

Quicksort

# Binary search

Binary Search is defined as a searching algorithm used in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The idea of binary search is to use the information that the array is sorted and reduce the time complexity to O(log N).
